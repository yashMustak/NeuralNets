# NeuralNets
It is too exciting to create a neural network from scratch in python. By doing this I understood the basics behind the neural networks and their mathametics. No doubt, the code is not optimized, since I didn't used numpy for my basic mathametical calculations of matrics. 
A simple explanation for the code:
* There exists a Class named neuralNetwork
* Constructor for the class object consists of an argument as a list which provides a basic structure of the network
* Class contains member functions to create the weight matrix
* Member function feed actually is Feed Forward algorithm
* Member function prediction, predicts the output i.e. the output neuron with maximum value
* Member function BackPropagate, actually takes the error back to every neuron
